# Spooky
You've been chosen for a dangerous mission! Deep in the underground there have been reports of people spotting ghosts! Your objective is clear: to eliminate all of the ghost in the underground! Are you ready to face them?

# Gameplay
First you have to walk a dark corridor - don't worry nothing scary here...
- Then you will **encounter your first fight with a ghost**:
    - To attack click on the green sections of the colorful bar (It's it doesn't register inputs please wiggle your mouse a little bit or/and click for longer). 
        - The closer you are to the middle the more damage you will deal. 
        - With each hit it will get smaller and smaller.
    - If you miss the green bar, the game changes now its enemy's turn:
        - The enemy will chance your mouse pointer / controler
        - If it touches you, you will recieve damage (quite high so be careful!)
    - Either of you can win by deapliting enemy's healt.
- If you are able to win (which may be a challenge) you will **enter the underground**, its a random generated place where you encounter ghosts by walking around a labirynt (This part of the game is extremly laggy and unstable from my tests it worked 9/10 times, but sometimes the player could not move.)

# Authors note
There was supposed to be more features but I got sick on the weekend so I didn't have much will to do them (there were supposed to be lvls, more types of enemies, custom fights - not only this simple cat and mouse thing).
